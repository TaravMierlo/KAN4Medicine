Implementing interpretable prediction of medical diseases based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks model.
See the paper "Interpretable Disease Prediction Based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks" for details.

The application of machine learning in the medical field has been a burgeoning area of research over the past decade. However, a significant challenge lies in the interpretability of disease prediction models. This study proposes a novel disease prediction model based on Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KANs), aiming to provide a new approach to an interpretable model architecture.
KAN is a novel neural network architecture that extends the network derived from the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, enhancing the transparency and reliability of the model by constructing an interpretable network structure.
This paper first introduces the theoretical foundation of KAN and its network design principles. It then validates the model's effectiveness in various disease prediction tasks through a comprehensive series of experiments and conducts a comparative analysis with existing machine learning models. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in various performance metrics, such as accuracy, average precision, aera under ROC, area under PR curve, compared to traditional models. Importantly, KAN enhances the model's transparency, enabling medical experts to comprehend the logic behind the predictions. This interpretability is crucial for clinical decision-making, as it allows healthcare professionals to understand the reasoning behind the model's outputs and make informed decisions based on the provided insights.
